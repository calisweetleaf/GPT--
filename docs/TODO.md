# GPT-Ã˜ Development Plan: System Integration and Validation

**Primary Objective:** Integrate all existing, production-ready components into a fully functional and verifiable system. The focus is on completing the final wiring, validating end-to-end functionality, and ensuring compliance with all operational and safety requirements.

---

## ðŸš€ PHASE 1: Final Integration (Top Priority)

### 1.1 `eyes` and `ears` Output Head Integration
- [ ] **Integrate `ISRMasterCoordinator` (`eyes_outputs.py`) into `gpt_model.py`:**
  - [ ] Import the `ISRMasterCoordinator` class.
  - [ ] Instantiate the head in the `GPT_Ã˜` model's `__init__`.
  - [ ] Add logic to the `GPT_Ã˜.forward()` or `GPT_Ã˜.generate()` method to route hidden states to the `eyes` head based on modality (`ModalityType.EYES`).
- [ ] **Integrate `SpatialIntelligenceCoordinator` (`ears_outputs.py`) into `gpt_model.py`:**
  - [ ] Import the `SpatialIntelligenceCoordinator` class.
  - [ ] Instantiate the head in the `GPT_Ã˜` model's `__init__`.
  - [ ] Add logic to route hidden states to the `ears` head based on modality (`ModalityType.EARS`).
- [ ] **Update `tokenizer_adapter.py` and `tokenizer_mux.py` for new modalities:**
  - [ ] Add `EYES` and `EARS` to the `ModalityType` enums.
  - [ ] Define and register special tokens for these modalities (e.g., `<|eyes_start|>`, `<|ears_start|>`).
  - [ ] Implement tokenization logic for the structured data associated with these heads.

### 1.2 CAS (Cognitive Architecture Specification) Integration
- [ ] **Finalize `NeuralMemoryRuntime` Integration:**
  - [ ] Verify that the `integrate_neural_memory_runtime` function correctly patches the `GPT_Ã˜` instance.
  - [ ] Ensure memory operations (store/retrieve) are actively and correctly called during the `generate()` loop.
  - [ ] Write a specific integration test to prove information is retained across generation calls.
- [ ] **Integrate `CAS` Constitutional Safety Framework:**
  - [ ] Ensure the safety constraints defined in `cas/cas_system.py` are loaded and applied during generation.
  - [ ] Create a test with an adversarial prompt designed to trigger a safety violation and assert that the model's output is constrained as expected.

## âœ… PHASE 2: Component Validation (Completed)

*The following core components have been reviewed and confirmed to be implemented to a production-ready standard. The primary remaining work is integration and end-to-end testing.*

- [x] **`run.py` Implementation & Orchestration:** Fully implemented with interactive TUI, component initialization, and multiple operational modes.
- [x] **`recursive_weights_core.py`:** Complete and production-ready implementation of the recursive weights system.
- [x] **`bayesian_config_orchestrator.py`:** Functional implementation of the Bayesian parameter optimization system.
- [x] **`tokenizer_adapter.py` & `tokenizer_mux.py`:** Comprehensive, multimodal tokenizer system is in place.
- [x] **`tool_output_head.py`:** Advanced implementation of the universal tool control head is complete.
- [x] **`cas/*` Subsystem:** All core components of the CAS runtime system are implemented.
- [x] **`gpt_model.py`:** Core transformer architecture is implemented and ready for final integration of all heads and subsystems.

## ðŸ§ª PHASE 3: Testing and Validation

- [ ] **Create `test/test_integration.py`:**
  - [ ] Write an end-to-end test for the `TEXT` modality.
  - [ ] Write an end-to-end test for the `TOOL` modality.
  - [ ] Write an end-to-end test for the `EYES` modality.
  - [ ] Write an end-to-end test for the `EARS` modality.
- [ ] **Create `test/test_cas_integration.py`:**
  - [ ] Write a test to validate `NeuralMemoryRuntime`'s ability to retain context.
  - [ ] Write a test to validate the constitutional safety constraints.
- [ ] **Run Full Test Suite:**
  - [ ] Execute all tests in the `test/` directory, including existing ones (`test_gpt_zero.py`, `debug_memory_test.py`, `validate_gpt_zero_system.py`).
  - [ ] Ensure all tests pass and that code coverage meets the project's strict guidelines (â‰¥90% line/branch).

## ðŸ“š PHASE 4: Documentation and Finalization

- [x] **Update `JULES.md`:** Update the agent's instruction file to be the single source of truth, reflecting the project's true status.
- [ ] **Review and Update `README.md`:** Ensure the main `README.md` is consistent with the final, integrated state of the system.
- [ ] **Submit Final Code:** Once all integration and testing are complete, submit the final pull request.
