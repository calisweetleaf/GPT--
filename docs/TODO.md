# GPT-√ò Development Plan: Field Readiness

**Primary Objective:** Achieve a fully functional, interactive command-line interface (CLI) for end-to-end testing and validation of the core system components. This plan prioritizes getting the model operational in a real-world testing environment before completing all extended features.

## üöÄ PHASE 1: CLI Field Readiness (Top Priority)

### 1.1 `run.py` Implementation & Orchestration
- [x] **Implement `_handle_chat_mode` in `GPTZeroLauncher`:**
  - [x] Create the main interactive loop to accept user input.
  - [x] Integrate `TokenizerAdapter` to encode user prompts into tensors for the model.
  - [x] Call the `gpt_model.generate()` method with the encoded input and appropriate context.
  - [x] Integrate `TokenizerAdapter` to decode the model's output tensors back into human-readable text.
  - [x] Print the final response to the console.
  - [x] Manage conversation history within the chat loop.
- [x] **Complete `_initialize_system_components`:**
  - [x] Ensure `GPT_√ò`, `TokenizerAdapter`, `BayesianConfigurationOrchestrator`, `NeuralMemoryRuntime`, and `UniversalToolControlOutputHead` are all instantiated and wired together correctly.
  - [x] Verify that the `device` (CPU/GPU) is correctly determined and passed to all relevant components.
- [ ] **Enhance `_handle_monitor_mode`:**
  - [ ] Ensure all metrics from `SystemMetrics` are correctly fetched and displayed in the `rich` layout.
  - [ ] Connect the monitor to the `NeuralMemoryRuntime` and `GPT_√ò` to display real-time memory and reasoning stats.
- [ ] **Implement `_handle_tools_mode` (Basic):**
  - [ ] Create a simple loop to accept a tool synthesis objective.
  - [ ] Pass the objective to the `UniversalToolControlOutputHead`'s `synthesize_tool_response` method.
  - [ ] Display the synthesized tool's basic information as a proof-of-concept.

### 1.2 Core Component Integration & Validation
- [x] **Finalize `GPT_√ò.forward()` and `GPT_√ò.generate()`:**
  - [x] Ensure the `forward` pass can process token embeddings and produce valid logits.
  - [x] Complete the `generate()` method to handle the full text-generation lifecycle: input processing, reasoning, generation, and output formatting.
- [ ] **Validate `BayesianConfigurationOrchestrator`:**
  - [ ] Confirm that `get_parameter_value` is successfully used by `GPT_√ò` during initialization.
  - [ ] Implement a basic mechanism in `run.py` to feed performance metrics back into the orchestrator.
- [ ] **Validate `NeuralMemoryRuntime` Integration:**
  - [ ] Confirm that the `integrate_neural_memory_runtime` function correctly patches the `GPT_√ò` instance.
  - [ ] Ensure memory operations (store/retrieve) are being called during the `generate` loop.
- [ ] **Validate `RecursiveWeightCore` Integration:**
  - [ ] Verify that `RecursiveWeightLayer` is being used for embeddings and in the transformer blocks.
  - [ ] Ensure the `RecursiveWeightRegistry` is populated during model initialization.

### 1.3 Resolve Critical Dependencies & Stubs
- [x] **Fix all import errors** that prevent `run.py` from launching.
- [x] **Complete placeholder implementations** in `cas_system.py` and `cas_integration_bridge.py` that are essential for model loading and configuration.
- [x] **Fill in essential `__init__` and `forward` methods** for all classes instantiated in `run.py` to ensure they are operational.
